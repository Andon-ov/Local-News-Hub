## Todo

Search and filtering: Built-in search functionality is useful, and filtering by categories, data, and other parameters can provide more flexibility to users in selecting news.

Notifications and Subscriptions: The addition of subscription functionality and notifications on new articles is a good addition that allows users to receive up-to-date news according to their preferences.

Archive: Storing old news in an archive is useful as users can view and explore previous events.

Mobile Optimization: Mobile optimization is important as more and more users access the internet through mobile devices. Make sure your website is responsive and easy to use on different mobile platforms.
