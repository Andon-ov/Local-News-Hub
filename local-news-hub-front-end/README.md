# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Local-News-Hub
Local News Hub is a web application that aggregates local news from various sources and presents them in one place for easy access. The aim of the project is to help local communities stay informed about the latest news and events happening in their area. The application is built using React and Django and is designed to be scalable and easy to use.


<!-- TODO -->

Search and filtering: Built-in search functionality is useful, and filtering by categories, data, and other parameters can provide more flexibility to users in selecting news.

Notifications and Subscriptions: The addition of subscription functionality and notifications on new articles is a good addition that allows users to receive up-to-date news according to their preferences.

Archive: Storing old news in an archive is useful as users can view and explore previous events.

Mobile Optimization: Mobile optimization is important as more and more users access the internet through mobile devices. Make sure your website is responsive and easy to use on different mobile platforms.
